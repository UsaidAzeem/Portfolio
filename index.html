						<p>To what I believe...</p>
<p>Every field out there requires a perspective that can add to its potential. My perspective has been honed through years of learning and trying, especially failing.</p>

<p>I don’t believe in mainstream ideals, a problem should be looked at with curiosity, not resentment. I plan to work to find better solutions and paint better pictures with the tools I’ve acquired over the years.</p>

<p>Across my main role and various contract projects (plus the occasional odd jobs), I’ve worked hands-on with AI systems, optimization algorithms, web development, 3D and visual programming, graphic design, political computation, and a variety of applied models.</p>

						<p>Born in a quaint town in Azad Kashmir , my roots extend to Birmingham UK. My schooling years were repetitive and long going up to 12 hours a day of cramming through school and tuition. </p>
					<p>My time during COVID was spent in a prestgious boarding school on a strict routine, living there had me adapting to various circumstances.</p>
					<p>My university days were spent working on various modes of experimentation, drfiting through optimization algorithms and evolutionary computing to ML models and ANNs, finally making my wway to various researches and ventures out in the real world.  </p>

      In retrospect to my trade, Ai has been an adversary to my work, Depending on it ruins your ability to strive and furthermore adapt. In that sense one cannot make better things, once you settle down for a certain solution, you're never moving further. My researches may not be perfect or developed but they have been attended to by my focus and attention. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So for every problem I encounter I treat it with the respect of learning. I spend my time knowing how it happens and it's impact. Then after careful trail and not-so-careful error I find my way to a solution. Hence these are my prized possessions.
    </p>

    <p>
    AI is pandora's box. You rely on it and hope on it, forgetting the years of computing and skills that have been nurtured to find better solutions. I'm afraid I do use Ai as well but I'd be better off without it. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Years of various tools in Graphic Designing, 3D, Evolutionary programming, Computer Vision, NLP , Logical Reasoning and ofcourse Machine learning and Deep Learning have brought me to a "Jack of All Trades" situation. Hence I yearn for a chance to find more to study and even more to solve.    </p>

          Dia-TTS: Text-to-Speech System<br />
          Designed a full TTS pipeline using Dia 1.6B via gRPC with a Gradio front-end for story telling. This was done using Dia which was currenlty an up and coming model rivaling most giants. It allowed for a shortened training data req and performed quite decent.

		  With my work at the Attar industral area in Pakistan<br />
          Designing a high-speed defect detection system for paper manufacturing using a Raspberry Pi and industrial camera. Instead of deep learning, the system relies on classical computer vision techniques such as thresholding and geometric shape analysis to minimize computation. The idea is to make it accesible for basic tasks instea dof making it costlier than just taking the loss of a bad product.

      <h5>My FYP – DIS-EXT (2026)</h5>
      <p>
        Large-scale social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become prominent spaces for individuals and groups to express opinions, beliefs, and ideological standpoints. Due to their scale, openness, and real-time nature, monitoring extremist discourse has become highly complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        DIS-EXT (Discourse Intelligence on Extremism) is a system I developed using NLP to analyze publicly available Twitter data. It performs high-granularity sentiment analysis, contextual filtering, and historical user profiling to detect patterns of ideological alignment over time. This project focuses on providing structured insights into public discourse beyond single-post analysis, capturing long-term behavioral tendencies of users.

      <h5>Industrial Projects – Attar Industrial Area, Pakistan (2026)</h5>
      <p>
        <strong>Multi-Camera Surveillance System:</strong> Designed a cost-effective, round-robin surveillance system for unauthorized disturbances. By distributing computation across multiple client PCs and using threaded processing, the system detects anomalies efficiently without expensive hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High-Speed Anomaly Detection for Paper Production:</strong> Developed a factory-level defect detection system using a $300 industrial camera and a Raspberry Pi instead of typical $2,000 setups. The system leverages classical computer vision techniques (thresholding and shape detection) to identify defects in real-time, minimizing losses and maintaining product quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        These projects emphasize reducing processing cost while maintaining performance, enabling scalable industrial monitoring solutions.

        I am looking to contribute to fields where challenging problems demand thoughtful solutions. My experience spans political analytics, industrial systems, telecommunications, and emerging AI-driven technologies, and I am eager to explore new domains where real impact can be made.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to work with teams or organizations that are solving complex, high-stakes problems — whether that’s optimizing industrial operations, developing intelligent systems for social or political insights, or building innovative platforms for emerging technologies. I value roles that combine research, experimentation, and practical implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, I aim to focus on work that drives measurable improvements, creates meaningful experiences for users, and challenges me to grow as a problem solver across industries.
